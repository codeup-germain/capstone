# Data Science Pipeline
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
<!-- Describe your Data Science Pipeline process -->
Following best practices I documented my progress throughout the project and will provide quick summaries and thoughts here.

### Planning
- Communicate with teammates about strengths and weaknesses to find team members that can lead specific sections in the work.
- Clearly outline and define our goal as being a teams chance of winning at the 20 minute mark in a league of legends game.
- Build out a trello board that the team can reference that contains an outline of information we will use when completing the rest of the datascience pipeline.
